    In 1961, Leonard Cohen published The Spice Box of Earth, a collection of poems including "The Unicorn Tapestries".
    The opening sequence of the 1982 animated movie The Last Unicorn was designed in reference to the tapestries, with 
    <br>
    many elements such as the fountain and lions, as well as the overall style being extremely similar.
    The seventh tapestry in the series ("The Unicorn in Captivity") appears briefly in Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, adorning the wall of a corridor near the Room of Requirement and the tapestry is seen in the various common rooms (Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff) with different coloured backgrounds. Also appears in the movie Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. At Universal Studios in Los Angeles and Orlando replicas of this tapestry can be see adorning the wall in the queue for the Forbidden Journey ride which replicates the interior of the Hogwarts Castle.

    The tapestries' millefleur were adapted and redesigned by artist Leon Coward for the mural The Happy Garden of Life in the 2016 sci-fi movie 2BR02B: To Be or Naught to Be as part of the mural's religious allusions.[29] The flowers are modeled on those in The Unicorn in Captivity.
    Elementary school readers of Mary Pope Osborne's popular Magic Tree House series are introduced to the tapestries and the Cloisters Museum in Blizzard of the Blue Moon.
    The tapestries are the subject matter of Samuel R. Delany's short story "Tapestry," found in Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories.
